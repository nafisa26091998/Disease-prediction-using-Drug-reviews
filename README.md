# Disease-prediction-using-Drug-reviews
"Using machine learning models to analyse the drug descriptions, side effects, and reviews and then recommend the drug for each patient's health condition."

To predict a disease suffered by a person, using machine learning algorithms, this project utilizes https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Drugs.com%29 dataset, which provides patient reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a 10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online pharmaceutical review sites. This data was published in a study on sentiment analysis of drug experience over multiple facets, ex. sentiments learned on specific aspects such as effectiveness and side effects.
